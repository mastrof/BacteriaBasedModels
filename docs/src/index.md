# BacteriaBasedModels.jl

Agent-based modelling of bacterial motility and chemotaxis in Julia.

## Features
- Built on [Agents.jl](https://juliadynamics.github.io/Agents.jl/stable/)
- Bacterial motility in 1, 2 and 3 dimensions with customizable motile patterns.
- Chemotaxis with different tunable models (Brown-Berg, Brumley, Celani, Xie).
- Integration of differential equations in parallel with agent stepping via [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/stable/).
- Easy evaluation of quantities of interest (mean-squared displacement, autocorrelation functions...).



## Future directions
- Swimming in flow fields.
- More behavioral strategies (chemokinesis, infotaxis...).
- Extended set of core functionalities (encounters, interactions...).
- Complex environments (non-spherical obstacles).
- Steric interactions and non-spherical microbes.

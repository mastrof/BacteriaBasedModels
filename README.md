Bactos.jl is a Julia framework for agent-based simulations of bacterial behavior, built on the amazing [Agents.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDynamics/Agents.jl)).

The package is still at an early stage of intense development.
Most of the core API should be stable for the foreseeable future, but many tweaks, improvements and additions still need to be made.
